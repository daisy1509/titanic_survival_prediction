# titanic_survival_prediction

[Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview) on Kaggle is a great competition to get started with machine learning basics. The details of the project are as follows.

## Project Details

Kaggle's Titanic Dataset contains information of all the passengers who were on board and whether they survived or not. The **Survived** column is the target of the dataset which contains the survival of the passengers. In this project I explore Sklearn's different libraries to perform data preprocessing and automate these processes using Pipelines.

### Objective

The objective of this project is to create a machine learning model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

### Libraries Used
* Pandas
* Sklearn
* RandomForestClassifier

## Data Structure
* **data** contains all the required data sets
* **submission** contains files created for submissions
